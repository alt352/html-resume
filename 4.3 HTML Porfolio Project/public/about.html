<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/ >
<p>Hello! I’m Arneisha Tanner, a Florida native who relocated to Arkansas in February 2024 to embrace new opportunities and personal growth. I graduated with high honors from Vanguard High School in Ocala, Florida, in 2017, and earned an Associate’s Degree in Liberal Arts in 2019.</p>

<h2>Professional Journey</h2>
<p>My career began in warehouse operations, where I developed strong organizational skills. I then transitioned to roles as a delivery driver and customer service representative, gaining valuable experience in client relations. From 2020 to 2022, I served as the head coach for the junior varsity girls' basketball team at my former high school, where I honed my leadership and mentoring abilities. Currently, I work in B2B inside sales, leveraging my communication skills to build strong business relationships.</p>

<h2>Aspirations and Learning</h2>
<p>I’m passionate about self-development and have set ambitious goals to become a freelance web developer, loctician, business owner, and stock market investor. To achieve these, I’m actively learning to code through Udemy courses, developing capstone projects, and building websites for my future ventures.</p>

<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading, writing poetry, listening to music, building LEGO sets, fishing, taking walks, and spending time with my two dogs and rabbit. I’m deeply passionate about family, mental health, overcoming obstacles, and beating the odds.</p>
