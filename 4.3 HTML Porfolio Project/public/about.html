<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is Arneisha Tanner. I was born and raised in Ocala, FL mostly by my mother. I graduated from Vanguard High School in 2017. I was a member of the Nation Honor Society and on the basketball team. Also, I did dual enrollment through the College of Central Florida where I continued my education after high school. I graduated with my Associate degree in liberal arts in 2019. The field I studied was Business and Organizational Management with a specialization in Management Information Systems.</p>

<p>I’ve worked mostly in warehousing and customer service roles throughout my professional career. I was the head coach for the JV girl’s basketball team at my former high school during 2020-2022. I first found interest in IT and coding careers near the end of 2020 while coaching alongside my former head coach. He is a systems administrator and conversations piqued my interest in the field. I’ve done some studying for the CompTIA A+ certification but at the time I was distracted by other things.</p>

<p>Recently, I found interest in Full-Stack Development and after learning what it is, I began taking a course to learn more about it and how to do it. After going through the HTML section of the course, I realized how much fun I was having while learning, practicing, and building projects. I decided to dive in and learn as much as I could about Full-Stack coding and how I could be better at it. Ever since, I have been working to perfect my craft with coding and also freelancing to build clientele.</p>
